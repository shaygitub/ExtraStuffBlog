ALONE TOTALLY
1. set breakpoint in gdb after rand when value is in eax
2. info registers eax to show the randomised value
3. key ^ randomvalue = 0xdeadbeef, so 0xdeadbeef ^ randomvalue = key, used this logic to calculate what to 
write into key, in my case: randomvalue = 1804289383, key should be = 0xb526fb88 (3039230856)
4. do next to keep going until input line and input decimal value into key
5. MAKE SURE TO RUN IN /TMP AFTER RECOMPILING - ACCESS DENIED TO FLAG IF NOT
flag: "Mommy, I thought libc random is unpredictable..."
