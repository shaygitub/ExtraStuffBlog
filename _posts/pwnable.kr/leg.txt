ONLY RESEARCH IN GOOGLE AND WRITEUP FOR MEANING OF MAJOR INSTRUCTIONS - I DONT KNOW MUCH ARM

needed information-
r3: register that holds return value from function like rax in x86
lr: holds the value of the address that the current function will return to (return address, will jmp to it in ret)
pc: holds the value of the address of the next instruction + 4

1. look at c source code, basically just need to figure out the value of r3 in the end of each key function
2. figure out the last value of r3 in each of the 3 functions and add the values:
2.a. last value of r3 is pc, which in this case is 0x00008ce0+4
2.b. last value of r3 is pc + 4, which in this case is 0x00008d06 + 4 + 4
2.c. last value of r3 is lr, which in this case (address of instruction after calling key3) is 0x00008d80
2.FINAL. sum of these values is 108,400 (0x0001 A770)
