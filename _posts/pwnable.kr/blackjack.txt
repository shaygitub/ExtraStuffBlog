FUCKING EASY
look at source code of betting function:
int betting() //Asks user amount to bet
{
    printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
    scanf("%d", &bet);

    if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
    {
        printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
        printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
        scanf("%d", &bet);
        return bet;
    }
    else return bet;
} // End Function
