This blog is going to focus on topics that im interested in / want to research about, specifically:
- Windows kernel (dpcs/apcs, HAL.sys, ETW and the event scheduler, different hooks and vulnurabilities)
- Windows drivers (vulnurability researching about specific drivers, either new or old and exploitation)
- Virtualization (specifically hypervisors, VTL1/0, HVCI and VBS)
- Other topics related to processor architecture / operating systems / low level researching (maybe pwnable?)

* Some of the parts are going to be in hebrew (like the dpcs/apcs entry) as i want to use this as a refrence page for different topics and i dont want to focus on traslation, some other topics will still be better in english so i will keep it that way
